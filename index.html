	<p> Java is a popular, versatile, and object-oriented programming language created by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) in 1995. It's designed to be platform-independent, meaning programs written in Java can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java follows the "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) philosophy, which has made it highly adaptable for various uses, including web development, desktop applications, and Android mobile development.</p>
